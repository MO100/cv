  <p>I am a student in Fresno State majoring in computer engineering. I enjoy learning about how our ancestors invented computers and how humans keep building on computers.
    I grew up more intrested in the software side of computers but while majoring in computer science I figured out that I wanted to also work with the hardware side.
    I hope to be able to continue learning more about computers in both the software and hardware aspects.</p>
